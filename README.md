During my CSE 598 : Introduction to Deep Learning class, I was given an assignment of classifying Iris Dataset using Quantum Machine Learning. I implemented 12 different ansatzes for 4 different embeddings using 2 different optimizers and compared their results.

The goal of this project is to see how well (and how quickly) quantum gates help the model to converge to a perfect accuracy. During my experimentation, I found that for every ansatz that was capable of seperating the classes, the speed that it showed for converging to a global optimum is extremely fast compared to a conventional deep learning architecture.
